## Features Implemented

- Utilizes **Bootstrapâ€™s grid system** to ensure all pages are **mobile-friendly** and work across different screen sizes.
- **Meta viewport tag**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` to maintain responsiveness.

### 2. **Navigation**

- A **fixed-top navbar** that includes:

      box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
      border-radius: 5px;
  }
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### **JavaScript Not Working for Bootstrap Elements**

#### Issue:

- Some Bootstrap elements like the **carousel** and **dropdowns** were **not working** initially.

#### Solution:

1. **Ensure Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript and jQuery are included** in the correct order:

   ```html
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   ```
2. **Scripts should be placed at the bottom** of the `<body>` to ensure they load after the HTML.
3. **Use `defer` for scripts in the `<head>` section** if necessary:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js" defer></script>
   ```

   This allows the **HTML to load first** before JavaScript executes, preventing issues with uninitialized Bootstrap elements.

## Areas for Growth

### **1. PHP Includes for Reusable Components**

- Currently, the navbar and footer are repeated across multiple pages.
- By using **PHP includes**, we can eliminate code redundancy:
  ```php
  <?php include 'navbar.php'; ?>
  ```
- This makes maintenance easier and ensures consistency across all pages.

### **2. Expanding the Product Catalog**

- Implement a **product catalog** with filtering options.
- Use **AJAX for dynamic loading** of products without refreshing the page.

### **3. Enhancing Klaviyo Integration**

- Automate personalized email campaigns based on user interactions.
- Implement **segmentation** for targeted promotions.

### **4. Upgrading to Bootstrap 5**

- The site currently uses Bootstrap 3.3.7.
- Upgrading to **Bootstrap 5** would provide better responsiveness and modern components.

### **5. Optimizing Performance**

- Reduce **HTTP requests** by minifying CSS and JavaScript files.
- Implement **lazy loading** for images to improve page speed.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bobs-appliances.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Ensure you have an internet connection for Bootstrapâ€™s **CDN resources** to load properly.

## Future Enhancements

- Upgrade Bootstrap to **Bootstrap 5** for improved performance and features.
- Implement **AJAX form submission** for the contact page.
- Add a **product catalog with filtering options**.
- Improve **Klaviyo email automation** to send targeted offers based on user behavior.
